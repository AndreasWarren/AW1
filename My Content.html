  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>My commitment to growing and developing myself firstly is my chief foundational principle. I am not a "know it all" but I am a "Can be taught anything fast learner".
    One thing that I am passionate about is learning. Exceptional leadership is all about being a student first.
    Be a "SOB" ( Student of the Business)
    Listen and learn twice as much as you talk and teach.
    "Stay curious"
    Be willing to "serve" twice as much as you're willing to instruct. Being curious is a character strength not a sign of low intelligence.
    "Appreciate and Value"
    Be grateful for every opportunity to exchange something meaningful with someone. Everybody matters, our time is finite and precious spend it thoughtfully. Value every moment someone gives you, do not underestimate what impact they may have that
    can be life changing.
    My commitment to personal growth has me constantly in a state of teachability.
    Providing a simple solution to a complex problem is invaluable and cost efficient.
    Identifying problems and finding innovative ways to tackle them before they occur takes foresight and attention to detail. Above all it takes a keen eye and an ear that is listening to what the data is showing. Pattern recognition of various
    analysis and reports from marketshare to market trends, down to feedback from consumers and vendors. Knowing where to apply and how to is a skill that starts with listening and learning.</p>
